  <h1>Hello World: Welcome to Elder.js!</h1>
  <p>Woot! You've got Elder.js installed. This template is designed to show you the ropes of how things work.</p>

  <p>
    We've tried to make this site a bit of a tutorial but be sure to check out the full
    <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js docs.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Enjoy playing around with Elder.js and if you hit a snag with the template open a
    <a href="https://github.com/Elderjs/template/issues">GitHub issue.</a>

  <h2>About This Template</h2>
  <p>
    This example project is made up of 3 routes, you can find them by looking within the
    <span class="code">./src/routes/</span>
    folder. They are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Home - The page you are on.</li>
    <li>
      Blog - Linked from above, but you can also see a blog post by checking out:
      <a href={link.blog({ slug: 'getting-started' })}>'Getting Started'</a>
      .
    </li>
    <li>Below we've also built a dedicated page for each one of the hooks Elder.js offers under the hood.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal in showing off these 3 routes is to give you enough of an example to see how a site is built with Elder.js
    but one that isn't too complex to overwhelm you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Chances are you are using
    <code>npm run dev:server</code>
    to preview this. If so, make sure you also check out
    <code>npm run build</code>
    which will statically generate this same site.
  </p>

<div class="hydrate">
  <div class="left">
    <h2>Partial Hydration:</h2>
    <p>Svelte.js shines at bringing interactivity to otherwise static websites.</p>
    <p>
      By default, Elder.js statically renders Svelte components only mounting them in the browser when it encounters a
      Svelte component which includes the
      <!-- Note: the actual prop is 'hydrate-client={}' but Svelte doesn't render empty objects-->
      <code>hydrate-client={JSON.stringify({})}</code>
      prop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://svelte.dev/examples#clock">clock</a>
      on the right is an example of a component that has been hydrated on the client.
    </p>
    <p>This approach makes it easy to build SEO friendly websites with Svelte for interactivity when needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <Clock hydrate-client={{}} />
  </div>

<h2>The Hook Interface</h2>

<p>
  Once you've digested the guides above and understand how to handle client hydration, we encourage you to explore the
  hook interface below.
</p>
<p>
  Hooks are the primary way to customize Elder.js and the list below outlines exactly what each hook can be used for.
